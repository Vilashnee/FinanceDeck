Welcome to Finance Deck - the budget tracking app that helps you take control of your finances!

With Finance Deck, you can easily track your spending and budget to make sure you are staying on track with your financial goals. Our app is made with React Context API and Speechly API, which makes it easy to use and efficient.

Some of the key features of Finance Deck include:

- Local storage to save your budget and spending data
- Speech control for easy input and interaction
- A sleek design that is optimized for user experience

To get started with Finance Deck, simply visit the app at the following URL: [https://elaborate-granita-360014.netlify.app/](https://elaborate-granita-360014.netlify.app/)

If you would like to start using the app with a clean slate, please make sure to delete any preloaded data before beginning. This will ensure that you have an accurate representation of your budget and spending from the start.

To run the app locally, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies by running **npm install**. Then, you can launch the app by running **npm start**.

To use the speech control feature of Finance Deck, you will need to provide training data, this can be found in the 'speechly.txt' file . This training data consists of a list of categories for income and expenses, as well as a series of commands for interacting with the budget tracking app.

The commands allow users to create, cancel, and modify transactions, as well as add categories, dates, and amounts to transactions. There are also commands for adding expenses and income to the budget.

To use these commands, you will need to invoke them using the Speechly API. For example, you might say "Create a transaction for $100 in the Food category on January 1st" to add a new expense to your budget.

I hope you enjoy using Finance Deck and that it helps you take control of your finances and reach your financial goals.
